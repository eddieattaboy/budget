bad attempt of self-gratification by making a productivity script

i've never once actually read a README document
sure, i've seen my fair share of them through pirated movies and hip hop albums,
  but they've all since been lost in the recycle bin once detected
not quite sure what i'm supposed to write in this README, as whatever i'll be publishing here is probably going to be self-explanatory

what i hope to achieve is to make something that's interesting to myself, and keep this learning process fun
i guess that's all

ta-ta, peace out
